# TasksGO

A modern task and ticket management system, designed to explore clean architecture and backend systems in Go.

## High-Level Concept

TasksGO will support:
- **Projects**, which group work
- **Tasks**, small actionable items, unrelated or related to tickets
- **Tickets**, issues, features or requests
- **Notes**, attached to tickets (role-dependent views)
- **Roles**: PM, DEV, QA

See [docs/tickets.md](docs/tickets.md) for detailed ticket design specs.

## Tech Stack (Initial)
- Backend: Go
- Frontend: React or Next.js (TBD)
- AI: Separate service (design TBD), python
- Database: TBD
