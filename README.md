### Description

TasksGO is a project focused on building a modern task and ticket
management system, designed to explore clean architecture and backend systems in Go


## High-Level Concept (🔄)
TasksGO will support:
- Projects, which group work
- Tasks, which represent small actionable items, unrelated or related to tickets
- Roles: PM, DEV, QA. 🔄❓
- Tickets, which represent issues, features or requests
- Notes, attached to tickers (can chnage depending the role)



The exact boundaries and relationships between these concepts will be refined
as the project evolves.

## Tech Stack (Initial) (🔄)
- Backend: Go
- Frontend: React or Next.js (TBD)
- AI: Separate service (design TBD) -- python
- Database: TBD
